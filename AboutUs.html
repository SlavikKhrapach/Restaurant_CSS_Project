			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<img src="Images\About.jpg" alt="Puzata Khata restaurant">
			<p>Puzata Hata (Пузата хата), founded in 2003, is a self-service chain specializing in serving ethnically Ukrainian food in Ukraine. It is based in Kyiv, but with branches throughout Ukraine. When you walk in, grab a tray, choose your dishes from the counter, pay at the register and find an empty table to enjoy your meal!</p>
			<p>The colorful interior recreates the atmosphere of a Ukrainian village of the early twentieth century. The menu consists of traditional Ukrainian dishes authored by the chef. There is a games room for younger guests.</p>
			<p>All kinds of salads, soups, fish, chicken, pork, pasta, blini, and fresh vareniki (mushrooms, cabbage, potatoes, meat, and salty cheese with dill, among others) are served alongside a wide variety of toppings, seasonal soups, and vegetables at Puzata Hata. More than 30 types of desserts are available, including cakes, cookies, ice cream and sweet vareniki — alongside, of course, coffee and tea.  </p>
			<p>With plenty of borsch, vareniki and chicken Kiev, cuisine at Puzata Hata is generally Ukrainian, though some branches offer alternatives such as pizza — and almost all locations offer samplings of Georgian cuisine. In all, each location offers over 300 dishes and is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>
			<p>Prices at Puzata Hata are generally low, and the restaurant is considered one of the most popular places to eat on a budget in Kiev. Student card holders receive a 10% discount at the register.</p>
